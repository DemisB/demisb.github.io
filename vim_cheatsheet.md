# VIM cheatsheet

## Motions

`f<character>` moves the cursor *on* the first occurrence of `character`.
`t<character>` moves the cursor *to* the first occurrence of `character` but not *on* it.
`I` goes before the first non-blank character of the current line in insert mode.
`A` goes after the last character of the current line in insert mode.

## Scroll

`zt` scroll such the cursor is at the top of the screen
`zz` scroll such the cursor is centered on the screen
`zb` scroll such the cursor is at the bottom of the screen

## Search and replace

`:s/foo/bar/g`

Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

`:%s/foo/bar/g`

Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.

`:%s/foo/bar/gc`

Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

`:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc`

Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
